        <p class="left">The main thing I wanted to get across with the branding was that this is a light hearted game, but with a slightly morbid, tongue-in-cheek name. I initially focused on the word exquisite, trying to emphasize that aspect of it, but the handwriting/cursive text style felt too dated. I also tried using different text styles for each of the words to bring it back to the idea of the segmented corpse, but that was too busy and incoherent. Eventually I fixed on a slightly squiggly looking text style that felt both a little creepy and a little goofy.</p>

      <p class="left">Through the development process, the mock up designs changed quite a bit. Initially there were three different fonts and five colors. As I started paring things back to find the best MVP, it changed to one type style for the logo, and three colors overall. The positioning of the logo also changed quite a bit, as the initial orientation looked too much like an “s”.</p>

      <h5 class="blue">Takeaways:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li class="bullet">All users had difficulty locating the “help” section. Need to adjust, maybe with a hamburger menu or always have a “help” icon in the bottom nav.</li>
          <li class="bullet">Users weren’t familiar with the game - one initially thought it had something to do with clothing.</li>
          <li class="bullet">All responded well to the styling, liked the colors, overall look of the app.</li>
          <li class="bullet">Had minor hangups with understanding how the prototype works - next time, might be better to allow them to select a tool and color before having the drawing show up, but was worried this would require creating way too many screens.</li>
          <li class="bullet">Trying to strike a happy medium between each process taking enough time to feel satisfactory, and not taking so long the user gets frustrated.</li>
          <li class="bullet">Could use a walk through to explain to new users what all features are.</li>
          <li class="bullet">Need to be able to go back to finished corpse screen after saving or sharing in case user wants to perform both actions.</li>

      <h5 class="blue">Future & Takeaways:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li class="bullet">Refine design.</li>
          <li class="bullet">Always more testing.</li>
          <li class="bullet">Do more competitive research, specifically in terms of design and functionality.</li>
          <li class="bullet">Add a walk through for new users to acquaint them with all features</li>

  <!-- LEARNINGS -->
  <section class="learnings">
    <h2 class="left">What I learned</h2>
    <div class="conclusion block">
      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet">The overall idea was very popular with everyone who was tested through the creative process. People responded really well to the design as well, and while not everyone was familiar with the game, I think by making it very easy to find the rules, it eliminated that issue.</li>
        <li class="bullet">More user and preference testing.</li>
        <li class="bullet">My initial branding was a little over the top, and required a lot of feedback to cull it back. I think it was a really valuable learning experience though, since it made me more aware of my own tendencies as a designer to go a little over the top.</li>
        <li class="bullet">I was mostly worried about the time constraints, and that has turned out to be my biggest issue. I would have liked to have gotten things done a little more quickly, but I’m also not sure I would have been as happy with the finished product as I currently am.</li>
        <li class="bullet">I was surprised by how few people had heard of this game, but also how excited people were by it, and how many users I tested wanted to be able to play the game right away.</li>
        <li class="bullet">Less is more - I started out with three different fonts, all different sizes and colors, and it was too chaotic. Also had five colors in the palette, which I reduced to 3. There’s good reason minimal designs are so popular and successful right now - the user needs to be able to understand what’s going on and what to expect.</li>
        <li class="bullet">It doesn’t make sense to start with things being crazy and paring back. I think that is easier to accomplish in terms of MVP with what features and how many screens are included in an app, but the actual branding can get a little more nebulous, depending on the customer. Since I was, in a way, my own customer for this, it was a little more difficult to make those decisions without external input, which is a valuable lesson in and of itself.</li>
