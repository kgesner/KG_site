She likes to make to do lists for her kids activities, make meal plans, share aspirational images and photos of her family. She mostly does this from home, but likes to have access from her mobile phone as well, when she’s on the go for her kids’ activities or a family outing.</p>

                  <p class="left">Jodi has a full time job of taking care of her three children, ages 8 - 14. Between kids activities, planning meals, taking care of the house and shuttling everyone to their respective activities, she has little time for herself and looks for services that can help her manage time. When she has a moment to herself, she likes to save recipes, share pictures with her friends and family, and relax on the couch with the family cat.</p>

In what little free time he has that isn’t devoted to work, he likes to ride his bicycle all over the city to stay in good shape. You have to stay in shape to keep your mind sharp, plus it gives him more free time to think about work! He also visits his family four times a year so his PTO doesn’t expire.</p>

            <p class="left">After testing my prototype, I made some major changes based on the results. Using the letter "d" in place of the Digs logo did not work because the users were not well enough aquainted with the brand to understand what it was, so I replaced it with the entire word. (One user thought the "d" stood for "dashboard".) I also simplified the nav bar, taking out the "Projects", "Help/FAQ", and "About" links, and consolidating those options into a more streamlined layout. I also added in the users profile image, and reduced the overall height to give the content more room. I also reduced the space between the content, so it's more centered for a responsive site design that will change the number of projects displayed horizontally depending on the screen size.</p>

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p class="left">Throughout this project, I found it most effective to use very basic processes to make the site easy for users to understand, meaning that each process has to broken down into the smallest steps to make each process as clear as possible. Sometimes it seemed counterintuitive to be breaking things down so minutely, but when I didn’t it, became very clear in the user testing and people would get confused. It is also extremely important to use appealing imagery to attract and draw users in. If someone sees something they like, or recognize as well designed, they are more likely be intrigued and continue clicking through your site.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="left">One aspect that didn’t pan out for the final project was the “Professional” subscription. It is still an option to potentially explore in the future, but it for the initial stages it made more sense to scale back the project and focus on more essential components. If time had allowed for it, I would have done more preference and usability tests to better understand what users are looking for, and explore a subscription option through surveys, but under the circumstances it felt like the right decision.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="left">All in all, the testing was clearly the most important aspect of this process. While making the sight beautiful and appealing is vital, you’ll never truly know what people want or expect if you don’t ask them, and that was the biggest takeaway from this project. Make sure to take all user feedback into account, and remember that getting other people’s opinions is the easiest way to gain a more objective perspective on your work.</p>
