      <img src="images/bio/who.jpg" alt="who1"  class="image">
      <h5>Who am I?</h5>
      <p class="left">Crafty, insatiably curious (nosy), obsessive problem solver.</p>
      <p class="left">I love anything to do with textiles - I knit, sew, embroider and weave. I also have a growing collection of houseplants that I like to talk to and pet, since I don't have any animals to pet (yet). The northeast is frozen half of the year, so surrounding myself with cozy fibers and vibrant greenery keeps me happy and warm.</p>

    <section class="what">
      <img src="images/bio/what.jpg" alt="what1"  class="image">
      <h5>What motivates me as a designer?</h5>
      <p class="left">I’ve always felt like I’ve been searching for something. This is perhaps best reflected by the wide range of places I’ve worked, from a quiet local library to a bustling French patisserie, at a rowdy summer day camp, for a saucy jewelry designer, in cozy knitting stores and at a national home décor brand. After years of uncertainty, it finally dawned on me: I was always catering to someone else’s passions. I do like structure and guidelines, but I like creative wiggle room too. I was unhappy and unchallenged; I wanted something that kept me mentally engaged while also allowing my artistic side to shine. Was that really so much to ask for?</p>

    <section class="when">
      <img src="images/bio/when.jpg" alt="when1"  class="image">
      <h5>When did I realize I loved design?</h5>
      <p class="left">I can’t remember a time when I didn’t love beautiful things, but realizing I specifically wanted to work as a designer took a little bit longer. My cumulative job experiences showed me, often by way of wanting someone else’s job, that I craved more autonomy. Being around designers wasn’t enough - I wanted to have the privilege of being trusted to make those decisions myself.</p>

    <section class="where">
      <img src="images/bio/where.jpg" alt="where1"  class="image">
      <h5>Where am I?</h5>
      <p class="left">Most likely somewhere in the northeast - I am currently based out of Massachusetts, but I love to travel whenever possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="why">
      <img src="images/bio/why.jpg" alt="why1"  class="image">
      <h5>Why did UX design appeal to me?</h5>
      <p class="left">I am a contradictory mish-mash of left and right-brained logic-loving nonsense. I excelled in English class, but both of my parents were scientists. I took AP Art for three years and earned my BFA, but have also very successfully held a (very boring) position in data entry, and keep an obsessive personal budget spreadsheet. I love the design process, but what I love even more is how it is guided and informed by good, rational research. It is beautiful, it is logical, and it makes perfect sense to both sides of my brain.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="how">
      <img src="images/bio/how.jpg" alt="how1"  class="image">
      <h5>How do my experiences make me a better designer?</h5>
      <p class="left">I’ve spent the past few years working at a home decor company, learning how to operate within particular brand guidelines. This helped me realize that I love the branding process - not only operating within established style guides, but also being the one to help establish them. I enjoy helping people understand how to translate their product and personality into a tangible, beautiful experience.</p>
